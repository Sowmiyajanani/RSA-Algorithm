It is a simple security algorithm it uses 2 large prime numbers p and q, and calculate n and euler totient function is also calculated.After that, public key e is also given so that private key d is calculated.Finally,ciphertext is successfully found.It is a type of Asymmetric Algorithm in which 2 different keys are used for encryption and decryption.
